Knockoff instagram, pretty cool <br>
A little project I started initially to learn more about client server relationships as well as how data is transferred between them. I learned alot about how to manage data on an sql database, how to use ajax to perform updates to the database without a page refresh, and how php is incorporated into html webpages as a bridge between the client and the server.
